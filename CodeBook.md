# Variables
##  
#### Each of the variables listed below is a column in the tidy data set.  Features [3]-[68] are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].  Each variable name is taken from the original data set [(see discussion thread)](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-014/forum/thread?thread\_id=179) unless it contains errors.  This naming convention is used to avoid verbosity (tBodyAccMeanX vs. Mean X-Direction Linear Body Acceleration in Time Domain).  The following section provides detailed descriptions of each variable.

# Transformations
1. Read the activity labels, feature names, test set components, and training set components
2. Determine the columns in the test and training set components related to mean (mean() suffix) and standard deviation (std() suffix) measurements using grepl
3. Filter the test and training sets using the indices of the columns obtained in the previous step
4. Combine the test and training sets using rbind
5. Label resulting set with descriptive names while:
  * Correcting any typos in original labels
  * Removing special characters from labels
  * Capitalizing labels accordingly to preserve camel-case labels
6. Create new data set with the average of each variable for each subject and activity using group\_by and summarise\_each
7. Output tidy data set to file using write.table
